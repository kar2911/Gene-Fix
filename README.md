## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Backend Requirements:**
  - Python 3.8+
  - pip package manager
  - Virtual environment (recommended)

- **Frontend Requirements:**
  - Node.js 16+
  - npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kar2911/Gene-Fix.git
cd Gene-Fix
```

#### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv gene_fix_env
source gene_fix_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: gene_fix_env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run database migrations (if applicable)
python manage.py migrate

# Start the backend server
python app.py
```

#### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
